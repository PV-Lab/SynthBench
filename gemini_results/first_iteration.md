# Unsolicited Summary

These sources explore the **challenge of predicting materials synthesizability**, particularly for inorganic crystals like perovskites. They highlight that current **machine learning and computational methods often propose materials that are difficult or impossible to synthesize**, underscoring the value of incorporating **human intuition and domain knowledge** from expert chemists. The proposed solution involves developing and testing **filters based on established chemical rules, structural characteristics, and synthesis techniques** to narrow down the vast number of computationally predicted materials to those with a higher likelihood of being successfully synthesized. The sources discuss the importance of **understanding reaction pathways, phase diagrams, oxidation states, and ionic radii** as key factors in determining synthesizability and suggest methods for capturing this knowledge into algorithms and workflows.

# What are the common these among the transcripts?

Based on the sources and our conversation history, several common themes emerge regarding the prediction and achievement of materials synthesizability:

*   **Synthesizability as a Key Challenge:** The sources consistently highlight that predicting and achieving synthesizability is a significant hurdle in materials discovery. It is not sufficient to predict a thermodynamically stable structure; the ability to actually synthesize it needs to be considered.
*   **Value of Tacit Knowledge and Human Intuition:** A central theme is the recognition that human intuition and the tacit knowledge held by expert chemists are crucial for determining synthesizability and often outperform purely computational or algorithmic approaches currently available. The project's approach is founded on the idea of capturing, documenting, and operationalizing this expert knowledge.
*   **Rules, Heuristics, and Filters:** Experts rely on a combination of established chemical rules, heuristics, and intuitions derived from extensive experience and knowledge of existing materials and synthesis methods. The project aims to translate these into computational "filters" that can be applied to screen potential new materials. Examples of such rules or heuristics discussed include those related to:
    *   **Size and Geometry:** Concepts like radius ratio rules, ionic radii, Hume-Rothery rules which incorporate size similarity, and tolerance factors (specifically for perovskites) are used to assess structural feasibility.
    *   **Electronic Structure and Bonding:** Considerations of electronic structure, oxidation states, valence shells, and bond types are fundamental to understanding chemical compatibility and stability.
    *   **Structural Similarity and Analogy:** Looking at known structures and similar compounds provides a starting point and helps predict what might be achievable. This includes looking at known structure types like Perovskites, spinels, or layered structures.
    *   **Coordination Environment:** Preferred coordination numbers and environments are considered.
*   **Influence of Processing and Kinetics:** Synthesizability is heavily influenced by the specific synthesis process and kinetic factors, not solely by the thermodynamic stability of the final product. Key aspects include the choice of starting materials or **precursors**, reaction pathways, solvents and reagents, temperature and reaction conditions, and potentially the use of additives. The interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic control is recognized.
*   **Analogy and Similarity in Synthesis Routes:** Just as structural similarity is used for predicting likely phases, known synthesis methods for similar materials are often adapted and used as a starting point for new compositions. **Topotactic similarity** is discussed as a specific concept related to synthesis, where structural similarity between the precursor and product nucleus can lead to lower interface energy and a lower nucleation barrier, aiding formation.
*   **Focus on Specific Material Classes:** While the goal is often to generalize rules and methods, the discussions frequently center on specific material systems, particularly **Perovskites**. This focus is driven by existing expertise, available experimental capabilities, and the aim to achieve a proof-of-concept demonstration.
*   **Experimental Validation and High-Throughput Methods:** The importance of experimentally validating theoretical predictions and filters is emphasized. The use of high-throughput experimental techniques is seen as essential for accelerating this validation process and enabling the synthesis of numerous candidates.
*   **Data and Literature as Sources of Knowledge:** Existing literature and experimental data are valuable resources for identifying empirical rules, understanding past successes and failures, and providing data for comparison and validation. However, it is noted that the reasoning behind specific synthesis choices, such as reagent selection, is often not explicitly documented in published papers.

These themes collectively highlight a multifaceted understanding of synthesizability that integrates theoretical insights, empirical rules from experience, and the practicalities of experimental processing.

# Can you make a list of all the rules and intuitions that have been talked about in the transcripts?

Based on the transcripts and our conversation, here is a list of the common rules, heuristics, and intuitions discussed regarding material synthesizability:

**I. Compositional and Elemental Properties Rules/Intuitions**

*   **Charge balance:** The concept that overall charge neutrality is important for stability and synthesizability was mentioned multiple times.
*   **Atomic size / Ionic radii:** Considerations of the size of atoms or ions are used to assess structural feasibility.
*   **Hume-Rothery rules:** These rules, which incorporate size similarity (a 15% similarity) and similarity in electrochemical nature, are used to distinguish between forming substitutional and interstitial mixtures and assess the likelihood of solid solution formation.
*   **Oxidation state:** The typical or preferred oxidation state of elements is a fundamental consideration. The probabilistic oxidation state probability (OSP) method was also mentioned as a way to approach this.
*   **Electronegativity:** Similarity in electrochemical nature, related to electronegativity, is part of the Hume-Rothery rules.
*   **Valence shell:** The electronic configuration of elements plays a role in bonding and structure.
*   **Stoichiometry:** Materials often adhere to specific stoichiometric ratios that form stable families of compounds.
*   **Electron counting rules:** Rules like the 12 electron rule were mentioned in the context of screening materials.

**II. Structural Rules/Intuitions**

*   **Structure type specific rules:** There are rules that apply to particular structure types, such as Perovskites, to determine if a combination of elements is reasonable for that structure.
*   **Rules connected to the structure itself:** Beyond stoichiometry, there are rules tied to the specific arrangement of atoms in a crystal structure, such as what elements can sit on particular crystallographic sites. The concept of looking at structure was mentioned early on.
*   **Structural similarity / Analogy to known structures:** Comparing a proposed material's structure to known, synthesizable structures provides a strong indication of its potential synthesizability.
*   **Coordination environment / Preferred coordination number:** The number and arrangement of neighboring atoms around a central atom are important factors considered by experts. Validating coordination numbers against known ranges from databases can be used as a filter.
*   **Bond type / Bonding angle:** The nature of the chemical bonds and the angles between them are fundamental to material formation and influence the applicability of rules.
*   **Bond length:** Calculated or expected bond lengths, perhaps from DFT calculations or databases of known structures, can be used to assess structural feasibility.
*   **Steric hindrance/effects:** Size and spatial arrangement (sterics) play a role in determining if a structure can form [71 (flowchart step 1), 90].
*   **Disorder:** While solid-state chemists often prefer ordered structures, disorder is a factor that exists in materials and can sometimes be used advantageously. Tendencies towards disorder might be estimated.
*   **Geometry:** Geometric considerations, such as the shape of the electron shell, are important.

**III. Process and Kinetic Considerations/Intuitions**

*   **Choice of starting materials / precursors:** The selection of initial reactants significantly impacts the synthesis pathway and outcome. The type of precursor can inform processing conditions.
*   **Synthesis pathways and methods:** The specific experimental method used (e.g., solid state synthesis, liquid synthesis, mechanical synthesis like ball milling or ion beam infringement, acid synthesis) is crucial for synthesizability.
*   **Reagents and Solvents:** The specific chemicals and solvents used in a reaction are vital, though the reasoning behind these choices is often implicit in literature. Common solvents like Dmf and Dmso were mentioned for perovskites.
*   **Temperature and reaction conditions:** Parameters like temperature, heating time, humidity, and atmospheric environment strongly influence whether a material can be formed.
*   **Additives:** The use of additives can potentially increase the synthesis window or aid in achieving a target phase.
*   **Kinetic reaction-energy barriers:** The energy required to overcome kinetic barriers in the synthesis process is a key factor in whether a reaction will proceed.
*   **Topotactic similarity/synthesis:** Structural similarity between the precursor and the desired product can facilitate synthesis by lowering energy barriers.
*   **Diffusion-limited vs nucleation limited phase transitions:** Understanding the mechanisms governing phase transitions during synthesis is important.
*   **Form factor sensitivity:** Whether synthesizing a material in bulk form or as a thin film can affect synthesizability.
*   **Intermediate phases:** Anticipating and controlling the formation of intermediate phases during synthesis is part of the experimental challenge.
*   **Metastability:** While thermodynamic stability is often the target, the ability to synthesize metastable phases is also relevant.
*   **Thermodynamics:** Heuristics for thermodynamics, comparing energies of structures to databases, and understanding the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic control are fundamental.

**IV. Knowledge Sources and Strategies**

*   **Human intuition / Tacit knowledge of experts:** This is repeatedly emphasized as a crucial, often undocumented, source of knowledge for determining synthesizability.
*   **Empirical rules:** Many rules used by chemists are empirical, derived from observation, but may also have a scientific foundation.
*   **Scientific foundation:** Rules often emerge from underlying principles of electrostatics, chemical bonding, and physics.
*   **Knowledge from existing literature and databases:** Existing data and published synthesis recipes are vital resources. However, the "why" behind specific choices is often missing.
*   **Knowledge from chemistry education:** Information typically taught in undergraduate chemistry courses is seen as foundational.
*   **Looking at known examples:** Examining the properties and synthesis routes of known materials, such as known catalysts, can provide insights.
*   **Identifying failure modes:** Understanding why synthesis attempts fail is crucial for developing effective strategies. This knowledge can be part of an "oral tradition".
*   **Generalizing from specific cases:** Starting with specific examples and working towards generalized approaches or flow processes is a strategy discussed.
*   **Identifying commonalities by collecting rules:** The idea of collecting rules from different areas of chemistry to look for overarching commonalities was suggested.

**V. General Principles about Rules**

*   **Rules are guidelines, not strict laws:** They accelerate thinking and analysis but can have exceptions, which are often chemically interesting. There isn't a set of rules that can absolutely certify that something *will* work.
*   **Rules exist at different levels:** There are rules based purely on composition and others connected to structure types or specific crystallographic sites. Rules can be arranged on a scale of generality/complexity.
*   **Rules can be context-dependent:** Rules may change depending on the material class, bonding types, or bonding angles.
*   **Synthesizability is process-sensitive:** The ability to synthesize a material is inherently tied to the experimental process used.
*   **Synthesizability involves the informant:** It is recognized that determining synthesizability is influenced by the knowledge and intuition of the chemist.
