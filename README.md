# SynthBench
A synthetic hypothesis testing environment for synthesizability filters.\
To run the code use either the  Jupyter Notebook Test_Bench_isovalent_generator.ipynb or Test_Bench_Stoichiometry_filter.ipnyb.\
For each filter describe a separate python ".py" file and import it into the notebook.\
For screening a list of materials import your material list into the jupyter notebook as shown in Test_bench_Stoichiometry_filter.ipnyb.\
To use the isovalent_filter see the example case in Test_bench_Isovalent_generator.ipnyp
